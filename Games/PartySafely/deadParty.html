      <h1>Sometimes You Get in with the Wrong Crowd</h1>
      <p>Sometimes you just start hanging out with the wrong people, so maybe you do things you wouldn't normally, but you wouldn't want to be defined by that short phase or that one thing you did. Take Hitler for example, even 100 years later, he will still be the guy that industrialised genocide on a scale never seen before or since, all because of a short phase when he was like 50. Clearly, even if any of the allegations against our former leader were credible, we shouldn't be defined by those few times when our party punch was allegedly spiked.</p>    </div>

      <h1>No One Will Stop You Here</h1>
      <p>Here at The Dead Party, we couldn't stop you from getting higher than Mount Everest if we wanted to. We don't have nearly enough members or enough money after all the skimming to higher anymore staff at our parties. You can do whatever you want and know that you can bare the consequences of your actions all on your own without someone judging you.</p>

      <h1>Drinking Games!</h1>
      <p>All games are fun, but drinking games are the best because you don't remember the fun part, you just remember the killer hangover the next day, you know what they say, "no pain, no gain", and all this while risking your life, "no risk, no reward".</p>

      <h1>We're so Confident (and Broke) that We Don't Need (or Have) Anymore Promotional Material</h1>
      <p>Since our research and writing teams allegedly went missing we having been lacking promotional material, but we are so confident that you will make the wrong decision that we don't need to say anything more. People are dumb so you will come to our party anyway. Chad was a regular at our parties and Chad was cool, so our parties must be way more cool than and "Dead" Party The "Dead" Party can cook up. (And we will steal and image from them just to show how we can even make blatant plagiarism cool).</p>
