        <p>The world wide web, (which is the www at the beginning of all links), is one of the most important collections of software to our current day society.</p>
        <p>All websites are assigned URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators. When requesting to access information on a website, what really happens is that your computer is sending an HTTP request to a web server to access the information.</p>
        <p>Once the request has reached the physical server, a virtual server inside the physical server (that is using the physical serverâ€™s resources) will search for the requested file in its own storage space.</p>
        <p>Once it finds the file the server will read it, process it and then send it back to the browser.</p>
        <p>We use servers instead of computers because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>A dedicated web server is always connected to the internet.</p></li>
          <li><p>A dedicated web server can have the same IP address, this is known as dedicated IP address.</p></li>
          <li><p>Internet Service Providers do not provide a fixed IP address for home lines.</p></li>
          <li><p>A dedicated web server is typically maintained by a third party.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is HTTP?</h3>
        <p>
          HTTP is a protocol, which is a set of rules for communication between 2 or more devices.
          HTTP cannot remember things such as passcodes, progress or incomplete transactions.
          This means it is Stateless. There are other server protocols that are not stateless and can remember.
